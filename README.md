# Dynamic-Power-Allocation-for-Noma
This project is a simulation project for Power Allocation over 5G network.

The current supported algorithm :
- Simulated Annealing
- Hill Climbing

The current supported scenario : 
- Three User Equipments A, B, C
- Two Base Stations X, Y

where
user A and C are connected to Base Station X
user B and C are connectoed to Base Station Y
